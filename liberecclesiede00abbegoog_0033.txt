PREFACE. xvii

'l'heir later history comprises, 10 two generations of Earls, more romanae
and mystery than have fallen to the lot 01 any other name in the

Scoteh peeraga. On the forfaiture 01 John Earl of Govvry, David first
Viscount of Stormont obtained a grant of the Abhacy of Scene.

The old Chartulary 01 Scene is a small thiu folio written on parch· ,

ment, consisting 01 81 leaves, and containing transcripte 01 8301110το01
deeds. It is defective iu several places, and tha sheets which remain
have net been properly bound. This chartulary does not eontain the
foundation eharter 01 the Abbey hy Alexander I. vhe earliest deed 10
abull 01 Pope Alexander 11. 10 11643 and with the exception 01 the
'four deeds which occur at the eud 01 the volume, the latest are the
chartars by Robert 1., which are dated in the ecch year 01 his reign,
or 1326. From that circumstance, and from the character of the
writing, we may proncuuce it to have been written 001 later than the
year 1350. This volume formed part 01 Sir J ames Ballour‘s collection,
aud was purchased in 1698, along with hia other Mss, hythe Faculty
of Advocates, in whose library it newis.

'Phe other and more recent chartulary is a larger folio 00 parch-
ment, bound in blue morocco. 11 00001010 01 76 leaves, and 01 the
eud 01 the volume there are about 50 leaves which have been left
blank. As the rtth leaf terminatas iu the middle 01 0 deed, and the
three or four succeeding leaves are ruled, so as to mark that there had
origdnally been an intention 01 proceeding father, 11 may be pre-

sumed that the scribe was interrupted before his task was completed.

This chartulary contains 148 deeds, many 01 which are 001 contained
